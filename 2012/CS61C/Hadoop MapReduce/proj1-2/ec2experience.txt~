Unfortunately, I ran into a great deal of trouble connecting to the freaking ec2 servers. To make matters worse, the server ended up shutting down right before count-order and in my opinion completed for the first times, due to  auto-shutdown. I had to run those jobs twice on the 5cluster. I had copy failures, and all kinds of problems. I did start late, (Saturday) because I was sick last week and got behind on all of my classes due to sleeping. 

Regardless, I was unable to run the same jobs on all 9 clusters.

On 5 Large:

Job1 had 316 mappers, 32 reducers. Job2 had 32 mappers, 1 reducer

"jurisprudence"  Job1: 21mins, 12sec Job2: 48s, 

"court order"  Job1: about 41min. 40s Job2: 7min. 

"in my opinion"  Job1: 62min. 44sec Job2:


3. 
5Large: The median processing rate (which was court order's) was 17.83GB/49min. or 0.0060635 GB/sec

For large 5, the effective cost was about ((input size * 3 jobs)/total cost). total time was about 2 hours, so 2.62GB/dollar
6. 

about 8hours of 5 large. (my code was fine, no errors, but I had connection issues) So 8*5*$0.68= $32.64

Yes. The combiner sums up minimum distances modified by f, and outputs that sum and the cardinality of the subset it received.
